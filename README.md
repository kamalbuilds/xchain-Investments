### 2. Problem Statement

#### Understanding Chit Funds

**Chit funds** are an ancient form of savings and credit system prevalent in many parts of the world, especially in India. They are community-based financial arrangements where a group of people agree to contribute a fixed amount of money regularly into a pool, which is then given to one member of the group in each cycle.

**How Chit Funds Work**:

- A group of individuals come together and agree on a fixed contribution amount and number of cycles.
- In each cycle, members contribute their share to the pool.
- The pooled amount is then auctioned or allocated to a member based on bidding or a lottery system.
- The member who receives the funds continues to contribute in subsequent cycles.
- This process continues until all members have received the pooled amount once.

**Why Chit Funds Were Used**:

- **Access to Credit**: Provided an alternative to formal banking systems, especially in areas where such services were inaccessible.
- **Savings Mechanism**: Encouraged disciplined savings among participants.
- **Community Trust**: Relied on mutual trust within a community, fostering cooperation and financial support.

**Challenges with Traditional Chit Funds**:

- **Lack of Transparency**: Limited visibility into fund management could lead to fraud or mismanagement.
- **Bias and Inequality**: Public bidding could be influenced by biases, affecting fair distribution.
- **Inefficiency**: Manual processes were time-consuming and prone to errors.

**Example of a Traditional Chit Fund**:

Consider a group of 10 people who agree to contribute $100 each month for 10 months. Each month, the total pool of $1,000 is given to one member. The selection of the recipient can be through bidding or a random draw. All members continue to contribute every month, ensuring that each member receives the lump sum once during the cycle.

#### Addressing the Challenges

XChain Pool Investments aims to modernize this concept by integrating blockchain technology to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency. By incorporating privacy features and decentralized governance, the platform eliminates biases and fraud risks associated with traditional chit funds.

#### Post-Cycle Investment:

- **Additional Funds**: Suppose during the cycles, some members delay their contributions and incur penalties or there are platform rewards.
- **Total Additional Funds**: Let's assume $1,000 accumulated over 6 cycles from penalties and rewards.
- **Investment by AI Agents**:
  - The $1,000 is invested in DeFi opportunities.
  - AI Agents analyze and choose the best options across multiple chains.
  - **Using CCIP**: Funds are swapped and moved efficiently between chains.
- **Returns**:
  - Let's assume the investment yields a 10% return over the remaining period.
  - **Total Returns**: $1,000 * 10% = $100.
  - **Total Investment Pool at End**: $1,000 + $100 = $1,100.

#### Final Withdrawals:

- **Distribution of Investment Returns**:
  - The $1,100 is distributed among all 10 members.
  - **Per Member Share**: $1,100 / 10 = $110.
- **Total Received by Each Member**:
  - **Members A to F**: Each received $5,000 when they won the bid.
  - **Additional Returns**: Each member gets an extra $110 from investment returns.
- **Total Contributions per Member**: $500 * 6 cycles = **$3,000**.
- **Net Benefit**:
  - **Members A to F**: Received $5,110 in total ($5,000 + $110).
  - **Members G to J**: Will receive their payouts in subsequent cycles or have received other benefits depending on the pool rules.

**Summary of Calculations**:

- **Total Contributions**: $3,000 per member.
- **Total Payouts**:
  - **Winning Members**: $5,110 each (including investment returns).
  - **Other Members**: Depending on pool rules, they may receive their lump sum in future cycles or other benefits.
- **Net Gain**:
  - **Winning Members**: $5,110 - $3,000 = **$2,110** net gain.
  - **Investment Returns**: An additional $110 per member.
